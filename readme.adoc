# summary

spring boot, kotlin, mongodb

### design

- products are copied into orders so no later product changes affect
existing orders
- (re)computing order price is trivial based on all the products
it contains (added function for convenience)

### run

production spring boot env variables are needed (like mongodb url)

### ignored things

- pagination
- time offset storing and computing
- limiting number of products in a single order
- unbounded search for orders

### TODO

* [x] validation
* [x] kotlin and java files in the same src dir. cross compilation
* [x] junit 5 + vintage
* [x] jasmine like tests
* [x] parameterized tests (maybe kotlin test)
* [ ] [.line-through]#java 9 modules, exports#
* [ ] springfox / swagger
* [ ] spring doc
* [ ] email validation in model
* [ ] index on dates
* [ ] check if switching to webflux works
* [ ] check swagger for webflux
* [ ] default spring-boot controller tests (smaller and more future-proof but slower and no spek)
* [x] maybe java LTS
* [ ] hystrix
* [x] circleCI
* [ ] sonar
* [ ] coverage
* [ ] badges
