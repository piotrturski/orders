# summary

spring boot, kotlin, mongodb

### design

- products are copied into orders so no later product changes affect
existing orders
- (re)computing order price is trivial based on all the products
it contains (added function for convenience)

### run

production spring boot env variables are needed (like mongodb url)

### ignored things

- pagination
- time offset storing and computing
- limiting number of products in a single order
- unbounded search for orders

### TODO

* [x] validation
* [x] junit 5 + vintage
* [ ] jasmine like tests
* [ ] parameterized tests (maybe kotlin test)
* [ ] java 9 modules, exports
* [ ] springfox / swagger
* [ ] spring doc
* [ ] check swagger for webflux
* [ ] maybe java LTS
* [ ] hystrix
* [ ] circleCI
* [ ] sonar
* [ ] coverage
* [ ] badges
