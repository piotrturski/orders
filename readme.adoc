# summary

spring boot, webflux, kotlin, mongodb

### design

- products are copied into orders so no later product changes affect
existing orders
- (re)computing order price is trivial based on all the products
it contains (added function for convenience)

### run

production spring boot env variables are needed (like mongodb url)

### ignored things

- pagination
- time offset storing and computing
- limiting number of products in a single order
- unbounded search for orders
